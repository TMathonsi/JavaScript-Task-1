## 🧪 Variables

### Exercise 1: Variable Declaration
1. Declare a variable `name` and assign your name to it.
2. Declare a variable `age` and assign your age to it.
3. Declare a variable `isStudent` and assign it to a boolean value indicating whether you are a student or not.
4. Print all three variables.

### Exercise 2: Variable Reassignment
1. Declare a variable `favoriteColour` and assign your favourite colour to it.
2. Print the value of `favoriteColour`.
3. Reassign `favoriteColour` to a different colour.
4. Print the new value of `favoriteColour`.

### Exercise 3: Arithmetic Operations
1. Declare two variables `num1` and `num2` and assign them any two numbers.
2. Declare variables to store the sum, difference, product, and quotient of `num1` and `num2`.
3. Print the results of these arithmetic operations.

## 🔢 Data Types & Operators

### Exercise 1: Numbers
1. Declare a number variable and assign an integer to it. Declare a variable and assign it a floating number.
2. Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus and exponentiation with a number variable and another number.
3. Print all your variables.

### Exercise 2: Boolean and Operators
1. Use comparison operators to compare two numbers and store the results in boolean variables.
2. Declare two variables `x` and `y` with the values `8` and `12` respectively.
   - Use comparison operators to check and print the following:
     - If `x` is greater than `y`.
     - If `x` is less than or equal to `y`.
     - If `x` is equal to `y`.
     - If `x` is not equal to `y`.

3. Declare the variables `a` and `b` with values `true` and `false`, determine and print the result of the following logical operations:
   - `a AND b`
   - `a OR b`
   - `NOT a`

4. Declare variable `p` and assign it a value of 10. Use the following assignment operators to modify the value of `p` with any number and print the result each time:
   - `+=`
   - `-=`
   - `*=`
   - `/=`
   - `%=`

## 🔁 Conditional Statements & Loops

### Exercise 1: Temperature check
1. Write a code using `if else` statements to check the temperature and print a message based on the following conditions:
   - If the temperature is below 0, print "It's freezing!"
   - If the temperature is between 0 and 15, print "It's cold."
   - If the temperature is between 16 and 25, print "It's mild."
   - If the temperature is above 25, print "It's warm."
2. Re-write the code using `switch` Statements.

### Exercise 2: Divisibility Check
1. Write a code using `if else` statements to check if a number is divisible by 2, 3, or both:
   - If the number is divisible both by 2 and 3, print "Divisible by both."
   - If the number is divisible by only 2, print "Divisible by 2."
   - If the number is divisible by only 3, print "Divisible by 3."
   - If the number is not divisible by either, print "Not divisible by 2 or 3."
2. Re-write the code using `switch` Statements.

### Exercise 3: For loops
1. Print numbers from 1 to 10.
2. Print all even numbers between 1 and 20.
3. Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 and print the result. Hint: `+=`
4. `const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];` Given the array of numbers, print each element to the console.
5. `const numbers = [3,7, 2, 5, 10, 6];` Given the array of numbers, find and print the largest number.  
   _Hint: current value and previous value._

### Exercise 4: While loops
1. Print numbers from 1 to 10.
2. Print all even numbers between 1 and 20.
3. Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 and print the result.
4. Print all multiples of 5 less than 50.  
   _Hint: `%`_

### Exercise 5: Do While loops
1. Print numbers from 1 to 10.
2. Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 and print the result.
3. Prompt the user to enter a number greater than 10. Keep asking until they enter a valid number.
4. Create a simple guessing game where the user must guess a number between 1 and 10. The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.
